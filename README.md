# chess_square
People make decisions when they play chess.

And that's why I'm interested in this boardgame.

At the same time, as a data geek, I really appreciate the cleanness of chess datasets.

My chess tutor was always saying NEVER FORGET THE CENTER which means when you play chess, you should occupy the central area on a board.

But, is his advice solid?

Learning from this webpage, (http://jkunst.com/r/visualizing-chess-data-with-ggplot/)

I started to make something with python myself.

My question is:

What is the occupied frequency of each square on a chess board?

I've got the data from Kaggle, (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) and let's do it.

You can:

see the final visualized result from chess_square.png;

read my code from chess_square.py; or

get the data from games.csv.

Hooya!

And here is my notebook on Kaggle
